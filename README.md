# Greetings

This is my first repository. 

I am a huge fan of python, web-development and sql. 
Eventually, I wanna have my own operation system that is only used by me.

#python
Here is a very basic class with the __init__ method.
>>> class Cat:
	def __init__(self,color,legs):
		self.color=color
		self.legs=legs

>>> Monkey=Cat("white",4)
>>> print(Monkey.color)
